# Orient-3Pt

A Grasshopper component that replicates Rhinoceros' "Orient by 3 Points" command. This tool allows you to orient geometry by specifying three reference points and their corresponding target positions.

## Description

Orient-3Pt is designed to work seamlessly within the Grasshopper environment and is compatible with Hops for enhanced workflow integration. The tool provides a simple yet powerful way to transform geometry based on three-point orientation, similar to Rhinoceros' native command.

## Features

- Orient geometry using three reference points and their target positions
- Optional scaling functionality
- Compatible with Hops and Grasshopper Player
- Simple and intuitive interface

## Input Parameters

- **Geometry**: Any geometric object you want to orient
- **Reference Points** (1, 2, 3): Three points on the initial geometry that define its current orientation
- **Target Points** (1, 2, 3): Three points that define the desired orientation
- **Scale**: Boolean toggle to enable/disable scaling during transformation

## Output

- **Oriented Geometry**: The transformed geometry in its new orientation

## Installation

## Usage

1. Load the component into your Grasshopper canvas
2. Connect your geometry and define reference points
3. Specify target points for the desired orientation
4. Toggle scaling if needed
5. Run the component to orient your geometry
