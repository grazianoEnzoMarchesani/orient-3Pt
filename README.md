This simple process emulates the "orient by 3 points" command in Rhinoceros. Is designed to work with Hops.

## Input

- Geometry: the geometry you prefer 

- refPoint 1 2 3: the reference points on the initial geometry

- targetPoint 1 2 3: the target points on which to orient your geometry
  - Scale: a Boolean value to define whether the geometry should be scaled or not

## Output
